# UI Challenge

This is a UI Challenge for an open position.


## Installation, building and running

First you should install all depended NPM packages. The NPM packages are used
for building and testing this package.

```shell
$ npm install
```

Now you can build the project.
```shell
$ npm build
```

And lastly, the following command will run the project.
```shell
$ npm run serve
```

## Usage

This project has a single modal with a form. It uses 2 different custom components that shows what is expected from the
Code Challenge itself.

## A few notes

While I was provided with some CSS guidelines, I found out that the components in the mockups and video were not in there so they were created from scratch.

I tried to recreate all the UI design and animations as close as I could but, I had to use bootstrap-vue and the bootstrap icon library to get a base for these new components.

I do understand the icons are not what you had in the challenge but the bootstrap components themselves were restyled to be alike of what was requested.
